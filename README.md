# Custom start page

it's just a static svelte page.
nothing to say about it.

# Customise

fork the repository as (your exact github username, case sensitive).github.io

in [+layout.svelte](https://github.com/M0rganeDev/M0rganeDev.github.io/blob/mommy/src/routes/%2Blayout.svelte), remove links you dont use, and add some that you do

then, just push your stuff and execute deploy.sh

# Notes

This start page use the same CSS and fonts as my main website, [morgane.dev](https://morgane.dev)

The search bar was stolen from [Lucas Oliveira on codepen.io](https://codepen.io/lucasyem/pen/ZEEYKdj)

To set your custom start page, you can use [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) on firefox
